Hello,

As already talked about by email, I am interested in knowing about the proposal.
I am an experienced applied mathematician, and with regard to this project, I have 
developed successfully three dimensional meshing algorithms both in C++ and in Python.

My distinctive skill to offer for these kinds of requirements is that I wrote my meshing
algorithms from scratch. I didn't use any CAD nor triangulation libraries because the way
I think a mesh results the better is when it is crafted starting from the particular object as target,
and then add generalization overloads as needed.
